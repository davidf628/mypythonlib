### Sendmail

This is a python module designed to make it easy to send a message through email in an automated fashion. To use this you must have a gmail username and password combination that is sent to the function for logging in - and the security protocols must be reduced in order for them to work, so I wouldn't advise using your main login.

You can set an alternate reply-to address to change where replies are sent to.
